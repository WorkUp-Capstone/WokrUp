<h3 class="welcome-h3">Our Vision</h3>
<p class="welcome-p">We strive to fulfill a niche, but necessary purpose - <strong>helping young developers to grow their portfolio and confidence</strong>.
    At WorkUp, we allow for grads of career-accelerating "boot camps" to connect with experienced developers while they pursue a job in
their newfound career.</p>
<br>
<p class="welcome-p"><em>As a project owner</em>, you may have some projects that you want a fresh pair of eyes on, or maybe you're looking for
some junior-level developers to acquire for your team. While our main goal is <strong>not</strong> to promote recruitment, we
believe the trade-off of miscellaneous workloads for real-world experience and network-building to be mutually beneficial. You can peruse
potential candidates and make contact with them if you believe they may suit your expectations!</p>
<br>
<p class="welcome-p"><em>As a new developer</em>, you may look at all available projects currently up for grabs; once a project is selected, you're expected to
    see it through to the end! Don't feel discouraged, though. You have an opportunity to review exactly what you're getting yourself into, and
may even contact the project owner via email for more details, if you'd like. Transparency is key, here. There's no shame in acknowledging your
current limits. By the way, these side projects are an amazing way to get credibility! Make some new connections and
broaden your programming horizons!</p>
